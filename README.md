## Introduction :dart:

Artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting topics in computer science today. The following workshop session aims to give you a general understanding of how genetic algorithm works, its benefits and limitations, and how to implement it in your own A.I. projects.

## Requirements :books:

- Python 3.8 -> Install python 3.8 [here](https://www.w3computing.com/python/installing-python-windows-macos-linux/)

## Workshop Content :bulb:

The workshop is divided into 3 parts:

- **Part 1**: Introduction and Understanding Genetic Algorithm
- **Part 2**: Genetic Algorithm Development and Optimization
- **Part 3**: Genetic Algorithm Implementation in different A.I. projects

**You will find the content of all these parts in the pdf [here](insert_pdf_path_here)**
